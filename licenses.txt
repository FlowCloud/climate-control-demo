            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                     Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                    Preamble

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.

        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)

        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.

        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.

        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.

        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                    NO WARRANTY

    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

NON-EXCLUSIVE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MPLAB® XC32 C COMPILER

This Nonexclusive Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a contract
between you, your heirs, successors and assigns ("Licensee") and
Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, with a
principal place of business at 2355 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ
85224-6199, and its subsidiary, Microchip Technology (Barbados) II
Incorporated (collectively, "Microchip") for the accompanying Microchip
software including, but not limited to, MPLAB XC32 C Compiler, and any
updates thereto (collectively, the "Software"), and accompanying
documentation, including images and any other graphic resources provided
by Microchip ("Documentation").

1. Definitions.  As used in this Agreement, the following capitalized
terms will have the meanings defined below:
    a. "Microchip Products" means Microchip 32-bit microcontrollers.
    b. "Licensee Products" means Licensee products that use or
incorporate Microchip Products.
    c. "Object Code" means the Software computer programming code that is
in binary form (including related documentation, if any), and error
corrections, improvements, modifications, and updates.
    d. "Source Code" means the Software computer programming code that
may be printed out or displayed in human readable form (including related
programmer comments and documentation, if any), and error corrections,
improvements, modifications, and updates.

2. Software License Grant.  Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, Microchip grants strictly to Licensee a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to:
    a. Use the Software on a single computer in connection with Licensee
Products; and
    b. If Source Code is provided, modify the Software, provided that no
Open Source Components (defined in Section 4 below) are incorporated into
such Software in such a way that would affect Microchip’s right to
distribute the Software with the limitations set forth herein.

For purposes of clarity, Licensee may NOT incorporate or embed any
portion of the Software into its own programs (including, for example,
any extracts or other output of the Software), except however Licensee
may incorporate extracts (in executable form) from any object libraries
into Licensee Products.

3. Documentation License Grant.  Microchip grants strictly to Licensee a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the

2 above, Licensee further acknowledges that certain components of the
Software may be covered by so-called "open source" software licenses
("Open Source Components"). Open Source Components means any software
licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative
or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any
license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed
under such license, requires that the distributor make the software
available in source code format. To the extent required by the licenses
covering Open Source Components, the terms of such license will apply in
lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the
licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the
restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source
Components, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source
Component.

    a. Standard Library Files.  Notwithstanding the license grant in
Section 2 above, Licensee acknowledges that “libc.a”, “libdsp.a”,
“libe.a”, “liblega-c.a”, and “libm.a,” library files
(hereafter referred to as, “Standard Library Files”) are covered by
third party licenses, as described below. To the extent required by the
licenses for Standard Library Files, the terms of such license will apply
in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the
licenses applicable to Standard Library Files prohibit any of the
restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Standard Library
Files, such restrictions will not apply to such Standard Library Files.

The Standard Library Files are derived from software developed by

        c. Free Software Foundation Code.  The following components of
the Software are derived from the Free Software Foundation, Inc.:

            (i)  The assembler, binary utilities, compiler, and linker
components of the Software are governed by the GNU General Public License
(“GPL”). For copies of the GPL go to http://www.fsf.org.

            (ii)  “libgcc.a” and “libgcov.a” library files are
governed by the GPL provided, however, that a binary exception clause
covering these library files applies, which states: “In addition to the
permissions in the GNU General Public License, the Free Software
Foundation gives you unlimited permission to link the compiled version of
this file into combinations with other programs, and to distribute those
combinations without any restriction coming from the use of this
file.”

For a complete machine-readable copy of the source code corresponding to
the files listed at Section 4(c)(i)-(ii) above, please refer to
Microchip’s website, or mail your request and $100 to Microchip
Technology Service Center, 2100 West 14th Street, Tempe, AZ 85281.

5. Third Party Requirements.  Licensee acknowledges that it is
Licensee’s responsibility to comply with any third party license terms
or requirements applicable to the use of such third party software,
specifications, systems, or tools. Microchip is not responsible and will
not be held responsible in any manner for Licensee’s failure to comply
with such applicable terms or requirements.

6. Licensee Obligations.  Licensee will not: (a) engage in unauthorized
use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or
Documentation, or its derivatives; (b) use all or any portion of the
Software, Documentation, or its derivatives except in conjunction with
Microchip Products; or (c) reverse engineer (by disassembly,
decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion thereof. Licensee may
not remove or alter any Microchip copyright or other proprietary rights
notice posted in any portion of the Software or Documentation. Licensee
will defend, indemnify and hold Microchip and its subsidiaries harmless
from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees), liabilities, and losses, including without
limitation product liability claims, directly or indirectly arising from
or related to the: (i) use, sale and distribution of Licensee Products;
and (ii) breach of this Agreement. THIS SECTION 6 STATES THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
INFRINGEMENT.

7. Confidentiality.  Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not
limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its
derivatives, underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas
relating to the Software, and the Documentation are proprietary
information belonging to Microchip and its licensors ("Proprietary
Information"). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein,
Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary
Information and will similarly bind its employees in writing. Proprietary
Information will not include information that: (a) is in or enters the
public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of
the receiving party; (b) the receiving party was legally in possession of
prior to receiving it; (c) the receiving party can demonstrate was
developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or
reference to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (d) the
receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on
disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information
by law, court order, or government agency, License will give Microchip
prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object
or limit such disclosure. Licensee agrees that the provisions of this
Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Software,
Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that
monetary damage alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its
licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees
that if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated such
provision then Microchip will have the right to injunctive relief,
without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all
other remedies at law or in equity.

8. Benchmarking.  This Agreement does not prevent Licensee from using the
Software for internal benchmarking purposes.  However, Licensee will
treat any and all benchmarking data relating to the Software, and any of
other results of  use or testing of the Software that are indicative of
its performance, efficacy, reliability or quality, as confidential
information.  Licensee will not disclose such information to any third
party without the Company’s express written permission.  The foregoing
restriction applies to benchmarking data that relates to the Software as
a whole or any portion thereof and such restriction is a condition to
exercising the licenses granted to Licensee (but will not be deemed a
condition to the use of any Open Source Components, to the extent such
restriction would be prohibited by the license applicable to such Open
Source Components).

9. Ownership of Proprietary Rights.  Microchip and its licensors retain
all right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation
including, but not limited to all patent, copyright, trade secret and
other intellectual property rights in the Software, Documentation, and
underlying technology and all copies and derivative works thereof (by
whomever produced). Licensee’s use of such modifications and
derivatives is limited to the license rights described in this
Agreement.

10. Termination of Agreement.  Without prejudice to any other rights,
this Agreement terminates immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon
a failure by Licensee to comply with any provision of this Agreement.
Upon termination, Licensee will immediately stop using the Software,
Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such
copies.

11. Warranty Disclaimers.  THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MICROCHIP AND ITS
LICENSORS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR
APPLICATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS
DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE, BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO
OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE.

12. Limited Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE OR OBLIGATED UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT OR
INDIRECT DAMAGES OR EXPENSES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR
LOST DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES,
OR ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DEFENSE
THEREOF), OR OTHER SIMILAR COSTS. The aggregate and cumulative liability
of Microchip and its licensors for damages hereunder will in no event
exceed $1000 or the amount Licensee paid Microchip for the Software and
Documentation, whichever is greater. Licensee acknowledges that the
foregoing limitations are reasonable and an essential part of this
Agreement.

13. General.  THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS. Licensee agrees that any disputes arising
out of or related to this Agreement, Software or Documentation will be
brought in the courts of the State of Arizona. This Agreement will
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. It will not be modified except by a written
agreement signed by an authorized representative of the Microchip. If any
provision of this Agreement will be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will
be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will
constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the
same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver will be effective
unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the
waiving party. Licensee agrees to comply with all export laws and
restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other
United States or foreign agency or authority. The indemnities,
obligations of confidentiality, and limitations on liability described
herein, and any right of action for breach of this Agreement prior to
termination, will survive any termination of this Agreement. Any
prohibited assignment will be null and void. Use, duplication or
disclosure by the United States Government is subject to restrictions set
forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of the Commercial
Computer-Restricted Rights clause of FAR 52.227-19 when applicable, or in
subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer
Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, and in similar clauses in the NASA
FAR Supplement. Contractor/manufacturer is Microchip Technology Inc.,
2355 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85224-6199. If Licensee has any
questions about this Agreement, please write to Microchip Technology
Inc., 2355 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85224-6199 USA. ATTN:
Marketing.

allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose
any Proprietary Information. 

THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR EXPENSES INCLUDING INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES
(INCLUDING ANY DEFENSE THEREOF), OR OTHER SIMILAR COSTS.  The aggregate
and cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors for damages
hereunder will in no event exceed $1000 or the amount Licensee paid
Microchip for the Software and documentation, whichever is greater. 
Licensee acknowledges that the foregoing limitations are reasonable and
an essential part of this agreement.

THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF
LAWS PROVISIONS.  Licensee agrees that any disputes arising out of or
related to this Agreement, Software or Documentation will be brought in
the courts of the State of Arizona.  If either the Microchip or Licensee
employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses.
